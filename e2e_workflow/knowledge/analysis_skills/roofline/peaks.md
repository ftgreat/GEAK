# Hardware peaks — roofline denominators

Pure data. One section per `gfx`. Extend by adding a section; nothing else needs to change.

Peaks are **dense, no-sparsity, sustained-achievable-ceiling** figures. HBM bandwidth is the
*theoretical pin* rate — real streaming kernels top out near 0.85–0.92 of it, which is exactly what
`target_eff` in `SKILL.md` encodes. Do not pre-derate the numbers here.

**Compute peaks need validation; the memory axis is the trustworthy one.** BF16 and FP16 run at the
same rate on the matrix core of every part below (MFMA on CDNA, WMMA on RDNA), so the two `flops`
entries in each section must be **equal** — they are, and that equality is the check to keep.
Empirical matrix-core microbenchmarks (e.g. from rocprof-compute) frequently report a BF16 peak ~2×
low, which inflates any BF16 compute-axis `roofline_pct` (sometimes above 100%, where `SKILL.md` §6
L3 flags it `suspect`). At decode, prefer `hbm_util` and only rank on a compute-axis number once its
dtype peak has been validated against this equality.

## Unknown gfx — derived fallback (confidence: low)

If the running `gfx` has no section above, DERIVE from `torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0)` and mark
`peaks.source="derived"`, `peaks.confidence="low"`:

```
hbm_bw_bytes_s ≈ memory_clock_rate_hz × (memory_bus_width_bits / 8) × 2     # DDR
flops[dtype]   ≈ multi_processor_count × clock_rate_hz × mfma_flops_per_cycle_per_cu[dtype]
```

The derived bandwidth is **frequently wrong for HBM3/3E** — the reported memory clock often understates
the effective pin rate (on gfx950 it derives ~4.1 TB/s against a real ~8 TB/s). Treat any derived-peak
result as `confidence: low`, which per `SKILL.md` means **display only, do not rank on it**.
